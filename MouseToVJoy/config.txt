Sensitivity = 2
AttackTimeThrottle = 100
ReleaseTimeThrottle = 100
AttackTimeBreak = 100
ReleaseTimeBreak = 100
AttackTimeClutch = 100
ReleaseTimeClutch = 100
ThrottleKey = 87
BreakKey = 69
ClutchKey = 67
MouseLockKey = 79
MouseCenterKey = 80
UseMouse = 1
AccelerationThrottle = 1.01
AccelerationBreak = 1.01
AccelerationClutch = 1.01


Acceleration works like this: X = (X + AttackTime) * Acceleration, X = (X - ReleaseTime) / Acceleration
If you want raw acceleration use 1 for time variables and scale acceleration
If you dont want acceleration set it to 1 and use linear time values
Use keycodes from 65 to 90 (65 for A, 90 for Z)
